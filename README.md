# FoodTraceability - TeamFoodSafenet

Foodborne illness is a significant issue worldwide. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) estimates that there are 48 million cases of foodborne disease in the US every year, causing 128,000 hospitalizations and 3,000 fatalities. Complex supply chains make tracking food contamination difficult and time-consuming for health organizations. Another challenge is the lack of availability of supply chain network data for backtracking to the source. The proposed Product tracking system aims to solve this by simulating data and automating the identification of potential sources of contamination within the supply chain network faster. Such a system could improve food safety thereby protecting public health and preventing financial losses. Data is generated based on the FDA (Food and Drug Administration) rule for maintaining additional traceability for different Critical Tracking events (CTE), which are different events in the supply chain. The objective of the project is to predict the contaminated nodes in the supply chain and to develop a graph database to store all the supply chain that was generated during phase 1 of the project. 

## Data Generation

In order to generate data, download the repository to your local drive. 

There are three ways to generate data:

1. Web App User Interface
2. Terminal Application
3. Python API

## Neo4J 

# Neo4J Graph Database
It handles both transactional and/or analytics workloads and is optimized for traversing paths through the data using the relationships in the graph to find connections between entities.
# Neo4j Desktop
1.You can manage as many projects and database servers locally as you like and connect to remote Neo4j servers.
2.Neo4j Desktop comes with a free Developer License of Neo4j Enterprise Edition. 

# Neo4j Bloom
 
1.Bloom is a standalone product focused on visualization that comes with every AuraDB Instance, and is available with a Neo4j Desktop.
2.It was designed for business analysts and other non-developers to interact with graph data without writing any code.
 
# Neo4j Browser
 
1.Neo4j Browser is an interactive cypher command shell for developers that allows you to interact with your graph and visualize the information in it.
2.Neo4j Browser is bundled with Neo4j and is available in all editions and versions of Neo4j.
